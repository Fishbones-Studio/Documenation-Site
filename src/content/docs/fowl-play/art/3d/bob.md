Bob is the first boss enemy that was created for Fowl Play. It is heavily inspired by a mutation between a pufferfish, chicken and spike ball. It is modeled, textured and animated in Blender 4.4.0.

## Model

The model of Bob is rather straightforward. Its main body is a ball, which was created using an UV Sphere. Additionally, the spikes ontop of it are primarily cones which the array mesh modifier was used on to duplicate the amount it has.

## Texturing

The textures for Bob focused on highlighting its unique mutated features while keeping a consistent look. Hand-painted details were combined with procedural textures to show the rough, spiky surface of the body. The main colors are muted earth tones with some metallic highlights to show its hard spikes and natural body.

## Animations

In the game Bob has two animations, an Idle and a Rolling animation. Both of these animations were aimed to make Bob stand out and feel more alive. 

### Idle

The Idle animation depicts Bob in a resting state, featuring subtle movements in its eyes and limbs that bring it to life. These motions also convey a sense of constant pain, reflecting Bobâ€™s tortured nature.

### Rolling

The Rolling animation shows Bob spinning forward aggressively, which is used as attacking or chasing the the player.
