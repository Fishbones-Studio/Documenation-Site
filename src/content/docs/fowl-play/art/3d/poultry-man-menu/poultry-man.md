## Poultry Man Arm

This is the current model for the ‘Poultry man arm’ that is going to be seen and moved in the main menu/hud of our game. Since you don’t actually see the poultryman himself, the arms had to be his most defining feature. With the tattoos, we try to show the player that this man is not to be messed with.
