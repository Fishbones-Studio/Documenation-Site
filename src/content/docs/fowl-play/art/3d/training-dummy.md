The Training Dummy is a special type of enemy in the game. It's main role for players to test out their equipments on, while also explaining the game mechanics and sometimes conveying climps of the outside world of Fowl Play to the players. This enemy can only be found in the Training Area inside the game. It is modeled, textured, rigged and animated in Blender 4.4.0.

## Model

The Training Dummy model is made using several separate meshes for different parts like the head, body, arms, and legs. Each mesh is modeled individually to make texturing, rigging, and animating easier. All the parts come together cleanly to form the full dummy model.

## Texturing

The texturing of the model is mostly done with texture painting, where colors and spots are mixed directly on the surface. Various brushes, like airbrushes and paint soft, are used to create smooth blends and different effects.

## Rig

For this model, a simple rig was created to make the animation process easier and more efficient. The rig includes basic bones and controls needed to move and pose the model without unnecessary complexity.

## Animation

This model has only one animation: the hurt animation. Since it serves as a testing dummy for players to try out their weapons and abilities, this was the only necessary animation.
