This is some concept art we made of the arena, showing the environment as well as game elements like the environmental hazards, a victorious chicken, enemies, and more. This was purely to see how a scene would look in our game.

For the 3D arena itself, we will add billboards above the ring, making the underground society really feel alive and moving. On those billboards, we want to show off art we've made that fits the game.
