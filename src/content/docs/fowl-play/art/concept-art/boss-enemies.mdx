We came up with a chicken centipede, a spiked chicken ball, and a frog egg spellcaster. We wanted every enemy to be extremely niche and unique so it would stand off from other enemies. All 3 bosses have some sort of mutation going on to stick with the original idea of mutating chickens who have to fight in the arena.
