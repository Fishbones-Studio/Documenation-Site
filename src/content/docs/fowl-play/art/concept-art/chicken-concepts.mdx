We started off with sketching a few chickens in the first week just to give ourselves and our team members an idea of what we’re going for at the time.

We decided pretty quickly on a clunky, low poly game which would fit the theme of our game as well, since we're going with mutated chickens who have to fight in an underground fighting arena.

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: chickenVariantsImage,
      alt: "Different chicken mutations",
      title: "Chicken variants and mutations",
      width: 500,
    },
    {
      src: chickenOverviewImage,
      alt: "Overview of chicken models",
      title: "Chicken Models Overview",
      width: 400,
    },
  ]}
  columns={2}

More variants of our chicken model, we wanted to implement different chicken models for the player to pick. so we came up with a basic chicken model which would have 4 different color variants. then there would be a silkie model which is a fluffier type of chicken and lastly a rooster model.

Early version of our chicken model. Here we were really just exploring different shapes and experimenting on how our chicken could/would look. It was used in the [chicken fighter prototype](/prototype/chicken-fighter)

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: leftOneImage,
      alt: "Left side of chicken model",
      title: "Left Side",
    },
    {
      src: leftTwoImage,
      alt: "Left side of chicken model",
      title: "Left Side",
    },
    {
      src: frontImage,
      alt: "Front view of chicken model",
      title: "Front View",
    },
    {
      src: sideImage,
      alt: "Side view of chicken model",
      title: "Side View",
    },

This is the current main chicken model. We tried making it feel a little sickly, by muting most colors and giving him an overall morbid vibe. As we said, we’re planning on implementing multiple chicken designs as we think having some sort of character customization/randomization will intrigue our audience more.

Some concept art of a potential previous victorious chicken that has fought in the arena. Inspired by Chuck Norris of course.
