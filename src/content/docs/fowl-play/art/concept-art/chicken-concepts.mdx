We started off with sketching a few chickens in the first week just to give ourselves and our team members an idea of what we’re going for at the time.

We decided pretty quickly on a clunky, low poly game which would fit the theme of our game as well, since we're going with mutated chickens who have to fight in an underground fighting arena.

More variants of our chicken model, we wanted to implement different chicken models for the player to pick. so we came up with a basic chicken model which would have 4 different color variants. then there would be a silkie model which is a fluffier type of chicken and lastly a rooster model.

Early version of our chicken model. Here we were really just exploring different shapes and experimenting on how our chicken could/would look.

This is the current main chicken model. We tried making it feel a little sickly, by muting most colors and giving him an overall morbid vibe. As we said, we’re planning on implementing multiple chicken designs as we think having some sort of character customization/randomization will intrigue our audience more.
