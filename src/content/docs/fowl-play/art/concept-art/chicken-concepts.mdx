We started off with sketching a few chickens in the first week just to give ourselves and our team members an idea of what we’re going for at the time.

We decided pretty quickly on a clunky, low poly game which would fit the theme of our game as well, since we're going with mutated chickens who have to fight in an underground fighting arena.

More variants of our chicken model, we wanted to implement different chicken models for the player to pick. so we came up with a basic chicken model which would have 4 different color variants. then there would be a silkie model which is a fluffier type of chicken and lastly a rooster model.

**For the boss enemies** we came up with a chicken centipede, a spiked chicken ball and a frog egg spellcaster. We wanted every enemy to be extremely niche and unique so it would stand off from other enemies. All 3 bosses have some sort of mutation going on to stick with the original idea of mutating chickens who have to fight in the arena.

This is some concept art we made of the arena, showing the environment as well as game elements like the environmental hazards, a victorious chicken, enemies and more. This was purely to see how a scene would look in our game.

**For the 3d arena** itself we will add billboards above the ring, making the underground society really feel alive and moving. on those billboards we want to show off art we've made that fits the game

Here are some concepts for the **weapons **we’re gonna be implementing in our game. These here are some of the more common weapons since we’ll be working with a common to legendary weapon system.

Common -> Uncommon -> Rare -> Legendary

Some concept art of a potential previous victorious chicken that has fought in the arena. Inspired by Chuck Norris of course.

**For the header art of our game **we’ve come up with a few different compositions, which are still a work in progress. We want the title of our game ‘’FOWL PLAY’’ to be shown boldly in the header art since the title is a wordplay on the gameplay. We also want the basic chicken model the player can choose to be the main chicken shown off in our art, if we stick to one main character the game will feel more cohesive.

for the compositions we want the main chicken and 1 or 2 of the big enemies showcased to make it feel action packed. In one of the first drafts you see the chicken fighter holding a minigun, one of the weapons in our game. We definitely want to implement one of our weapons in the header art just to give a sneak peek into the weapons that are obtainable from the shop.

In our game you’re supposed to feel small and weak, which in turn, make the enemies feel that more intimidating. We try to translate this to our art. Like here, where the chicken (main character) is running away from the enemies, looking scared and helpless.

Early version of our chicken model. Here we were really just exploring different shapes and experimenting on how our chicken could/would look.

This is the current main chicken model. We tried making it feel a little sickly, by muting most colors and giving him a overall morbid vibe. As we said we’re planning on implementing multiple chicken designs as we think having some sort of character customization/randomisation will intrigue our audience more.

‘Hennifer’ chicken variant.
