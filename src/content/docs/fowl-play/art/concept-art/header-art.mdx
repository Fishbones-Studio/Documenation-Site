For the header art of our game, we’ve come up with a few different compositions, which are still a work in progress. We want the title of our game ‘’FOWL PLAY’’ to be shown boldly in the header art since the title is a wordplay on the gameplay. We also want the basic chicken model the player can choose to be the main chicken shown off in our art. If we stick to one main character, the game will feel more cohesive.

For the compositions, we want the main chicken and 1 or 2 of the big enemies showcased to make it feel action-packed. In one of the first drafts, you see the chicken fighter holding a minigun, one of the weapons in our game. We definitely want to implement one of our weapons in the header art just to give a sneak peek into the weapons that are obtainable from the shop.

In our game, you’re supposed to feel small and weak, which in turn, makes the enemies feel that more intimidating. We try to translate this to our art. Like here, where the chicken (main character) is running away from the enemies, looking scared and helpless.
