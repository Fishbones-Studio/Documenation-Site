## Philosophy

The third fight theme was composed with the intent to immerse players in the unsettling, morally ambiguous world of underground chicken fighting and to remind them of the gruesome realities of the world they inhabit.
The music’s eery and disjointed qualities reflect the chaos and unpredictability of the arena, while its use of real-world samples and distorted sounds blurs the line between the familiar and the grotesque.
The goal was to create a soundscape that not only heightens tension during battles but also reinforces the game’s atmosphere of desperation, exploitation, and dark humor.

### Connection to Game Themes

This theme is tightly connected to the game’s core ideas of survival, exploitation, and the blurred boundaries between humanity and brutality.
The unsettling melodies and unpredictable structure echo the emotional turmoil faced by both the Poultry Man and his chickens, reinforcing the narrative’s focus on moral ambiguity and the cost of survival.

## Musical Parts

This theme can be divided into two parts:

1. **Beginning**: The song starts with a simple beat, layered with a xylophone like sound, interjected by the wind used in the [poultry menu theme](/fowl-play/art/music/poultry-menu-theme).
2. **Ending**: Distorted version of the beat, with a bunch of slowed down and sped up sounds, to create a disjointed feeling. The wind sound is more prominent here. Some additional normal samples are placed throughout, like bass notes and a bell like sound.
