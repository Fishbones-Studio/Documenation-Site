## Philosophy

This song is supposed to be fast and distorted, to celebrate the victory of the player.
To be in line with the other songs, this song once again features old school synths and a lot of 80s inspired sounds. The song ends by 'glitching'

This song is not really connected to the game themes, besides being based on the [victory theme](/fowl-play/art/music/victory-theme).

![Victory Theme Arrangement](../../../../../assets/fowl-play/art/music/game-over/arrangement.png)

## Mixing and Mastering

The victory theme has been distorted and sped up to 160 BPM, from the original 140 BPM.
Automation tracks have been used to create the 'glitch' effect at the end of the song, by automating Izotope Vinyl and Gross Beat

### Mixer Effects
- **Track 1**:
  - **Hardcore**: Distortion to create a more aggressive and guitar like sound
  - **Hyper Chorus**: Creates multiple, slightly detuned versions of the sound, to create a more full sound
  - **Izotope Vinyl**: Adds a vinyl effect to the sound, to make it sound more old school. Also used for the 'glitch' spindown effect at the end of the song
  - **Parametic EQ 2**: Used to cut out the high frequencies, to make the sound more muffled
  - **Gross Beat**: Used to create the 'glitch' effect at the end of the song
