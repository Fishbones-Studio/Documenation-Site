The Poultry Man Menu Theme is partially diegetic. The ambient wind sound is diegetic, simulating wind in the underground sewer system, but the ambient tracks playing on top are not diegetic.

## Philosophy

The Poultry Man Menu Theme is composed of several loosely connected musical fragments, all designed to evoke a sense of abandonment and isolation. At its core lies a continuous wind sound, emulating the desolate atmosphere of the underground sewer where the Poultry Man area is set.

Additional ambient tracks are layered on top, at random intervals. These pieces are slow and ethereal, built around chord progressions. Each segment lasts between 40 and 80 seconds. Once a track finishes, only the wind remains. In addition, sound effect play at random intervals, such as footsteps, to add to the atmosphere. Rivaling Poultry Men are also preparing for their next fight.

### Connection to Game Themes

The musicâ€™s sparse and minimal design fits with its area:

1. **Abandonment**: The persistent wind and minimal instrumentation convey emptiness and neglect.
2. **Mystery**: The unpredictability of random intervals mirrors the Poultry Man's elusive presence. Little is known about the Poultry Man.
3. **Isolation**: Long stretches with little to no melody emphasize the solitary atmosphere of the setting.

## Musical Parts

The Poultry Man Menu Theme is structured around a layering system:

1. **Base Layer**: A continuous wind sound forms the backdrop. Subtle variation in notes ensures the wind sound varies and doesn't become too tiring.
2. **Ambient Tracks**: Currently, four distinct tracks are randomly triggered over the base layer. While they share similar instrumentation, each features unique chord progressions and arrangements to add variety and depth. The ambient tracks are designed to complement the base layer, enhancing the overall atmosphere and emotional impact of the theme.

## Instruments and Sound Design

### Key Instruments

- **Wind Sound**: A synthesized wind sound, combining `Wind` and `Wind 2` from the Flex General Midi Library. Wind plays a continuous note, while Wind 2 is a more dynamic sound that changes slowly throughout the track.
- **Chord Synth**: A combination of Kepler Expo, for a warm sound, and UVI Workstation for a more high-pitched ethereal sound.

## Arangement

## Mixing and Mastering

### Mixing

- Automation is used for the sound level of the chords, to have them fade in and out.

#### Mixer Effects

- **Wind (insert 1)**:
  - Fruity Stereo Shaper, creates variation between the left and right channels.
  - Fruity Delay 3
  - Fruity Parametic EQ 2, to take out the highs and heavily boost the lows
- **Distand Sounds (insert 2)**:
  - Mirror, adds reversed delay
  - Fruity Reeverb 2, adding additional normal delay
  - Fruity Multiband Compressor
  - Fruity Parametic EQ 2, slightly boosting lows and mids and slightly lower highs

### Mastering

- Fruity limiter, to ensure sound levels don't become too high and prevent clipping.
