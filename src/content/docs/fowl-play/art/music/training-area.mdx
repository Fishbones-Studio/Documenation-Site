## Philosophy

The Training Area theme is designed to evoke loneliness and reflection, serving as a somber pause between battles. Its ambient, melancholic soundscape mirrors the Poultry Man’s conflicted role. The music’s references to the menu theme create a sense of continuity and quiet tension.

### Connection to Game Themes

This theme reinforces the game’s focus on survival, moral ambiguity, and exploitation.

## Musical Parts

This theme can be divided into three parts:

- **Beginning**: The song starts very light, with the wind used in the [poultry menu theme](/fowl-play/art/music/poultry-menu-theme), with some string sounds layered on top.
- **Middle**: The song becomes more busy, using vocoded effects and sampling lead 2 from the [poultry menu theme](/fowl-play/art/music/poultry-menu-theme).
- **Ending**: The song becomes more eery, adding white noise and sampling lead 4 from the [poultry menu theme](/fowl-play/art/music/poultry-menu-theme).
