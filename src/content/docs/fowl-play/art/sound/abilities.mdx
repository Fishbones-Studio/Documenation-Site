Sound effects for abilities in Fowl Play are designed to enhance gameplay feedback and create an immersive combat experience. Each ability sound is designed to match the visual effects, gameplay mechanics, and thematic elements of the game while providing clear audio cues to players.

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Details                |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Software      | Audacity, FL Studio 24 |
| File Format   | OGG Vorbis             |
| Purpose       | Event-driven feedback  |
| Diegetic      | Yes                    |

## Sound Design Principles

Our ability sound effects follow these core design principles:

- **Clarity**: Each sound must be distinct and recognizable
- **Impact**: Sounds should feel powerful and satisfying
- **Thematic Consistency**: Audio must match visual and mechanical themes
- **Gameplay Feedback**: Clear audio cues for timing and effects
- **Dynamic Range**: Appropriate volume levels for different ability types

## Ground Pound

Ground Pound is an ability that creates seismic impact. The player slams down forcefully, causing rocky debris to erupt from the ground in a circular area, dealing significant damage and applying knockback to all enemies within range.

### Design Philosophy

The sound design focuses on creating a visceral impact that emphasizes the raw power and earth-shaking nature of the ability. We aimed for a sound that would be:

- **Immediate and punchy**: Short duration with maximum impact
- **Satisfying feedback**: Rewarding players with a powerful audio response

### Technical Implementation

- **Base recording**: Physical impact sound created by slamming on a wooden desk
- **Processing**: Heavy distortion and reverb to enhance impact and depth
- **Frequency emphasis**: Low-mid frequency boost to emphasize the "weight" of the impact

### Created Sound Effect

## Earthquake

Earthquake is an area-of-effect ability that generates multiple seismic shock waves radiating outward from the player. Each wave damages enemies in an expanding circular pattern.

### Design Philosophy

The sound needed to convey the progressive nature of the earthquake while maintaining the powerful impact of each individual shock wave. Our approach focused on:

- **Rhythmic decay**: Multiple impacts that gradually diminish in intensity
- **Harmonic progression**: Decreasing pitch and lowering the volume of subsequent waves to represent energy dissipation

### Technical Implementation

- **Base source**: Ground Pound sound effect as foundation
- **Processing chain**: Delay effects synchronized with visual shock wave timing
- **Pitch modulation**: Gradual pitch shift downward with each wave

### Created Sound Effect

## Crescent Slash

The Crescent Slash ability executes two rapid slashes in front of the player, creating energy waves that damage enemies in a medium-range arc.

### Design Philosophy

We wanted this sound effect to convey both the sharpness of a blade and its mystical nature. The sound needed to be:

- **Sharp and precise**: Reflecting the cutting nature of the attack
- **Futuristic**: Matching the ability's more futuristic nature

### Technical Implementation

- **Base source**: Sword swing sound effect
- **Processing chain**: Dual playback (one reversed) for the two-slash effect
- **Effects applied**: EQ adjustments, phaser for the futuristic quality, heavy reverb
- **Software**: Processed in FL Studio 24

### Created Sound Effect

## Sanctuary of Firebloom

Sanctuary of Firebloom is a lightning-based ability where multiple electrical strikes descend from the sky to target the nearest enemy.

### Design Philosophy

To create the sound effect for this ability, we wanted something dramatic and impactful that matched both the visual spectacle and the powerful nature of the ability. The sound design focuses on:

- **Dramatic buildup**: Mimicking the approach of a storm
- **Divine power**: Conveying the sense of a celestial force striking down

### Technical Implementation

- **Base source**: [Thunder sound effect](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/loud-thunder-192165/) by Universfield
- **Falcon scream**: Made by floating into the mic, then sped up with light compression.
- **Processing**: Light distortion
- **Spatial effects**: Reverb applied to give more impact to each lightning strike

### Created Sound Effect

## Glacial Prism

Glacial Prism is an ice-based ability where crystalline shards emerge from the ground in a circular pattern, dealing damage to enemies while applying a slowing debuff that impairs their movement speed.

### Design Philosophy

The sound effect for this ability should capture the nature of ice formation. Our design focused on:

- **Sharpness**: Sharp, crackling sounds representing ice formation
- **Environmental atmosphere**: Cold wind effects to fit with the frosting theme

### Technical Implementation

- **Base source**: Plastic crackling
- **Atmospheric layer**: Wind sounds created by blowing into a microphone
- **Processing**: Light EQ and reverb for spatial enhancement

### Created Sound Effect

## Fireball

Fireball is an ability that launches a fiery projectile forward, which will move and change in size as it travels.

### Design Philosophy

The fireball stays traveling in the game world for a relatively long time, around six seconds, so the sound effect needed to be dynamic and engaging throughout its travel. It should not just loop the same 1 second audio clip.
The sound design focused on:

- **Dynamic travel**: The sound should change as the fireball moves
- **Clear**: The sound should be distinct and recognizable, even in a busy combat environment

### Technical Implementation

- **Base source**: Screaming into the mic, mixed with the sound of an egg cooking in a pan.
- **Processing**: Heavy distortion, phaser and audio mixing to smoothly transition between the two sounds.
