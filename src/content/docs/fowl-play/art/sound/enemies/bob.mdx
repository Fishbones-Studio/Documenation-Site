Bob is an extremely mutated chicken ball boss in Fowl Play. His sound effects are based on original vocal recordings and a sheep bleating sound, with heavy processing to create a unique and menacing effect. Bob is in a lot of pain. A glass bottle rolling on the ground was also used for his movement sound.

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Details                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Software      | Audacity, FL Studio 24  |
| File Format   | OGG Vorbis              |
| Purpose       | Telegraphing, immersion |
| Diegetic      | Yes                     |

The audio was cleaned up in Audacity, with noise reduction to remove background sounds. EQ, amplification, and compression were applied to enhance quality.
FL Studio was used for additional effects such as reverb, distortion, and phaser.
Final sound effects are exported in OGG Vorbis format, suitable for the game engine.

## Sound Design Principles

Bob is extremely mutated, so his sounds should be very different from normal chicken sounds. As a boss, his sounds are louder, more aggressive, and more distorted. Each sound should make it immediately clear which ability or action Bob will perform. The sounds are designed to be menacing and aggressive, reflecting his severe mutation.

## Created Sound Effects

Bob's sound effects fall into four main categories: idle sounds, telegraphing sounds, movement sound, and death sound.

### Idle Sounds

These play when Bob is not performing actions, giving him a lifelike presence in the game world.

### Telegraphing Sounds
