Sound effects for Boreass, a mutated fox with ice abilities in Fowl Play, were created using our own voice recordings with heavy processing. His movement sound effects are based on a recording of fingers tapping on a desk.

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Details                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Software      | Audacity, FL Studio 24  |
| File Format   | OGG Vorbis              |
| Purpose       | Telegraphing, immersion |
| Diegetic      | Yes                     |

The audio was cleaned up in Audacity, with noise reduction to remove background sounds. EQ, amplification, and compression were applied to enhance quality. FL Studio was used for additional effects such as reverb, pitch shifting, distortion, and autotune. Final sound effects are exported in OGG Vorbis format, suitable for the game engine.

## Sound Design Principles

BoreAss is a mutated fox with ice abilities. His sounds are more wolf-like than fox-like, with heavy processing to make him sound menacing. This choice was due to time constraints and the lack of access to real fox recordings. We referenced fox clips online, but the results ended up closer to wolf sounds, which is acceptable due to the overlap between the two animals and the unrealistic nature of our game. Each sound should make it immediately clear which ability or action BoreAss will perform.

## Created Sound Effects

Boreass's sound effects fall into three main categories: idle sounds, telegraphing sounds and movement sounds.

### Idle Sounds

These play when BoreAss is not performing actions, giving him a lifelike presence in the game world.
