The Elder Centipede is an extremely mutated boss in Fowl Play, made up of multiple chickens fused together human-centipede style. Its sound effects are based on original vocal and chicken recordings, with desk tapping used for movement sounds. All sounds were heavily processed to create a unique and menacing effect. The Elder Centipede is cocky, often sounding happy or laughing.

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Details                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Software      | Audacity, FL Studio 24  |
| File Format   | OGG Vorbis              |
| Purpose       | Telegraphing, immersion |
| Diegetic      | Yes                     |

The audio was cleaned up in Audacity, with noise reduction to remove background sounds. EQ, amplification, and compression were applied to enhance quality. FL Studio was used for additional effects such as reverb, distortion, phaser, and pitch shifting. Final sound effects are exported in OGG Vorbis format, suitable for the game engine.

## Sound Design Principles

Elder Centipede is extremely mutated, so its sounds should be very different from normal chicken sounds. As a boss, its sounds are louder, more aggressive, and more distorted. Each sound should make it immediately clear which ability or action Elder Centipede will perform. The Elder Centipede is cocky, so its sounds should be happy, laughing, and playful.

## Created Sound Effects

Elder Centipede's sound effects fall into four main categories: idle sounds, telegraphing sounds, movement sound, and death sound.

### Idle Sounds

These play when Elder Centipede is not performing actions, giving it a lifelike presence in the game world.
