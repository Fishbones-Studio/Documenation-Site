Sound effects for Hennifer, a [yandere](https://the-dere-types.fandom.com/wiki/Yandere) chicken enemy in Fowl Play, are based on original recordings of real chickens.

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Details                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Software      | Audacity                |
| File Format   | OGG Vorbis              |
| Purpose       | Telegraphing, immersion |
| Diegetic      | Yes                     |

The audio was cleaned up in Audacity, with noise reduction to remove background sounds. Light EQ, amplification, and compression were applied to enhance quality. Final sound effects are exported in OGG Vorbis format, suitable for use in the game engine.

## Sound Design Principles

Hennifer is not severely mutated, so her sounds should be clearly recognizable as chicken sounds, with minimal effects applied. Each sound should make it immediately clear which ability or action Hennifer will perform.

## Created Sound Effects

Hennifer's sound effects fall into three main categories: idle sounds, telegraphing sounds and movement sounds.

### Idle Sounds

These play when Hennifer is not performing actions, giving her a lifelike presence in the game world.
