Timmy is a young, mutated goose enemy in Fowl Play. His sound effects are based on original cockatiel recordings, with light processing to keep them natural. His movement sound effects are based on Lovebirds.

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Details                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Software      | Audacity                |
| File Format   | OGG Vorbis              |
| Purpose       | Telegraphing, immersion |
| Diegetic      | Yes                     |

The audio was cleaned up in Audacity, with noise reduction to remove background sounds. Light EQ, amplification, and compression were applied to enhance quality. Final sound effects are exported in OGG Vorbis format, suitable for the game engine.

## Sound Design Principles

Timmy is not severely mutated, so his sounds should be clearly recognizable. Each sound should make it immediately clear which ability or action Timmy will perform. Cockatiel sounds were chosen for their high-pitched, cute quality, fitting Timmy's character. The sounds are designed to be light and playful, reflecting his young age.

## Created Sound Effects

Timmy's sound effects fall into three categories: idle sounds, telegraphing sounds and movement sounds.

### Idle Sounds

These play when Timmy is not performing actions, giving him a lifelike presence in the game world.
