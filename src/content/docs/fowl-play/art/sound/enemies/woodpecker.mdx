Woodpecker is a heavily mutated enemy in Fowl Play. Its telegraphing sound effects are based on original macaw recordings, with heavy processing, mainly reverb, to create a unique and menacing sound. Its movement sound effects are based on original desk tap recordings.

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Details                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Software      | Audacity                |
| File Format   | OGG Vorbis              |
| Purpose       | Telegraphing, immersion |
| Diegetic      | Yes                     |

The audio was cleaned up in Audacity, with noise reduction to remove background sounds. EQ, amplification, compression, and reverb were applied to enhance quality. Final sound effects are exported in OGG Vorbis format, suitable for the game engine.

## Sound Design Principles

Woodpecker's sounds are designed to be sharp and aggressive, reflecting its mutated nature. Using a macaw as the base gives him a unique screeching quality, matching its severe mutation. Each sound should make it immediately clear which action Woodpecker will perform.

## Created Sound Effects

Woodpecker has no telegraphing sounds. This is because Woodpecker only uses standard [abilities](/fowl-play/art/sound/abilities) and weapons, without unique flair.
This means Woodpecker's sounds can be categorized in two categories: idle and movement

### Idle Sounds

These sounds play when Woodpecker is not performing actions, giving him an extra presence in the game world.

### Movement Sounds

These sounds play when Woodpecker is moving, providing feedback on its movement.
