The [Spike Ball](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/hazards/spike-ball) is a swinging hazard in Fowl Play, consisting of a large, spiked ball suspended by a chain. It moves back and forth, dealing damage to any player or enemy it touches. The sound effects for the Spike Ball were created using an original recording of a chain necklace being swung.

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Details                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Software      | Audacity                |
| File Format   | OGG Vorbis              |
| Purpose       | Telegraphing, immersion |
| Diegetic      | Yes                     |

The audio was processed in Audacity, with noise reduction applied to eliminate background sounds.
Equalization, compression, and reverb were used to enhance clarity and presence.
The recording was slowed down and pitched lower to match the heavy, deliberate swing of the in-game hazard.
The final sound effect was exported in OGG Vorbis format.

## Sound Design Approach

The Spike Ball is in constant motion, swinging rhythmically from side to side. Its sound effect is designed to emphasize this movement, providing a clear audio cue that telegraphs its path and danger.
