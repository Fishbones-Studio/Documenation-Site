The player in Fowl Play is a slightly mutated chicken. His sound effects are based on our own vocal performances and original recordings of chickens and lovebirds.

## Technical Specifications

The audio was first cleaned up in Audacity, with noise reduction to remove background sounds. EQ, amplification, and compression were applied to enhance quality.
The player movement sound effects make heavy use of pitch shifting and speed changes to the audio clips.
The final sound effects are exported in OGG Vorbis format, suitable for the game engine.

## Sound Design Principles

In order to make the player sounds feel more real, bird sounds were mainly used as a base.
Lovebirds were chosen for additional sound effects due to ease of access.

Player walking and running sounds are intentionally softer and less impactfull, to not take away from important sound cues.

## Created Sound Effects

The player sound effects fall into three main categories: idle sounds, movement sounds, and death sound.

### Idle Sounds

This sound effects plays at the end of the Idle animation.

### Movement Sounds

These play when the player is moving, providing feedback on the specific type of movement being performed.

<AudioPlayer

  title="Walking Sound"
  description="Slowed down sound of a bird moving around in its cage. A reversed section is played in the middle, to artificially lengthen the loop."

<AudioPlayer
  src="/sfx/player/movement/running.ogg"
  title="Running Sound"
  description="Sped up version of the walking sound, with a wind effect in the background. Wind effect was created by blowing into a mic, and adding a phaser effect on top of it. Together, these create the illusion of the wind blowing past the chickens wings."

<AudioPlayer
  src="/sfx/player/movement/jump.ogg"
  title="Jumping Sound"
  description="Sound of a lovebird jumping and flapping its wings. This sound has minimal effects, in order for it to be clear."
/>
<AudioPlayer
  src="/sfx/player/movement/glide.ogg"
  title="Gliding Sound"
  description="Heavily slowed down version of the jumping sound. In real life, when a chicken 'glides', it flaps its wings slightly. We wanted to incorporate this into the sound effect."

<AudioPlayer
  src="/sfx/player/movement/fall.ogg"
  title="Falling Sound"
  description="Wind effect with a reversed sound playing on top. More ominous than the other movement sounds, to indicate that the player is falling down."
/>
<AudioPlayer

  title="Dashing Sound"
  description="Created by mouth, with some slight reverb and pitch shifting applied. Used when the player dashes in any direction."

### Death Sound

This sound effect plays when the player dies, and is triggered by the death animation.

<AudioPlayer
  src="/sfx/player/death.ogg"
  title="Death Sound"
  description="Chicken scream sound, with a delay and phaser effect. Each echo is slightly pitch shifted down and has a lower volume."
/>

### Hit Sound

This sound effect plays when the player takes damage, providing feedback on being hit.
