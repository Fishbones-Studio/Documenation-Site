The [slingshot](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/ranged-combat/weapons/slingshot) and the [hazard it spawns](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/hazards/fire-pool) are accompanied by sound effects created by cracking an egg and pan frying it. These sounds were processed, cut, and combined in Audacity before being exported and imported into the game to enhance the player's experience.

## Philosophy

The slingshot is designed to be a high-impact, tactical weapon that emphasizes precision and area control over rapid fire. The weapon shoots exploding eggs, which spawn a fiery hazard on explosion. In order to sell this effect, the sounds for this weapon were created by actually cracking an egg. The sounds do not need to be realistic, thus some artistic liberties were taken for the explosion sounds. The explosions are drenched in reverb and distortion, to properly fit in with the other sounds, but still be clearly audible.
