The [butter knife](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/melee-combat/weapons/butter_knife) sound was created and processed in Audacity  
before being exported and added to the game.

## Philosophy

The butter knife is meant to feel light and almost unnoticed. It is not a serious weapon, so the sound should not draw too much attention. Still, we wanted a sound effect to give it some presence. The idea was to capture the feeling of cutting through air rather than hitting anything. For that reason, we used the raw stick swing recording without edits. It gives a soft motion sound that stays in the background while still giving feedback to the player.
