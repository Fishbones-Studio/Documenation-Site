The [dagger](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/melee-combat/weapons/dagger) sounds were processed, cut, and combined in Audacity  
before being exported and imported into the game to enhance the player's experience.

## Philosophy

The dagger was made to sound fast, sharp, and clean. It is a thin and quick weapon, so the sound needed to reflect that feeling. For the slicing part of the attack, two kitchen knives were recorded while being sharpened against each other. This gave a real metallic and slicing sound that fit the weapon.

For the throw effect, a stick was swung through the air and recorded to capture a natural whoosh. To make it feel like the dagger was spinning, the same whoosh sound was used multiple times. The second and fourth versions were inverted, which gave a back-and-forth spinning feeling. EQ was adjusted to make the sound clearer and more focused. A fade-out was also added at the end to make the throw feel more natural and complete.

EQ tuning was also applied to the other sounds to bring out the sharpness and reduce any unwanted noise.
