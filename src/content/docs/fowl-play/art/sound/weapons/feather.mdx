The [feather](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/ranged-combat/weapons/feather) sound was recorded and edited in Audacity  
before being added to the game.

## Philosophy

The feather is used as a projectile, so its sound needed to feel light and fast. The sound reminded me of Minecraft fireworks, so I tried to mimic that airy, shooting effect. I recorded myself fluiting softly into the microphone to get a natural, breathy sound. Then I processed it in Audacity using EQ and compression to make it clearer and smoother. I also reduced the tempo slightly to give it a slower, more delicate feel. The final sound is soft and airy with a sense of movement, fitting the floating projectile nature of the feather.
