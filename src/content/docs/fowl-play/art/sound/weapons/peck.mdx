The [peck](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/melee-combat/weapons/peck) sound was recorded and edited in Audacity  
before being added to the game.

## Philosophy

The peck is a quick, focused strike that should feel sharp and snappy. To match this, the sound was created by tapping a finger on a table. This gave a short, dry hit that fit the fast nature of the attack. After recording, EQ was used to shape the sound. Bass and treble were added to give it more punch and clarity without making it too heavy. The result is a clean, minimal impact sound that supports the motion without overpowering it.
