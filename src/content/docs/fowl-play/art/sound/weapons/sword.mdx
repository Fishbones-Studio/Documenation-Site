The [sword](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/melee-combat/weapons/sword) sounds were processed, cut, and combined in Audacity  
before being exported and imported into the game to enhance the player's experience.

## Philosophy

The sword is crafted to be a visceral, high-impact melee weapon that emphasizes weight, control, and brutal feedback over speed. Each swing is designed to feel heavy and deliberate, landing with a sense of finality. To bring this sensation to life, the weapon's sounds were built using assets from Uppbeat.io, such as metallic clashes and slash sounds. These elements were layered together to form a dense, aggressive audio profile.

The raw sounds were edited and shaped in Audacity using EQ and compression to emphasize low-end power and sharp high-end clarity. This helped create the impression of a heavy, forceful impact. A wind woosh sound, also sourced from Uppbeat.io, was added to convey motion and momentum, making the sword feel more dynamic and physically present. The result is a powerful, cinematic sound that captures the full force of every swing.
