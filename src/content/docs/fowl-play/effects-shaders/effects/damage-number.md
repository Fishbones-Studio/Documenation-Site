To enhance gameplay feedback and clarity during combat, we chose to implement floating damage numbers above the enemies when they are hit. This way we can give players instant visual feedback of when they hit their target and how much damage they have dealt. It also helps players track the effectiveness of damage upgrades in real time, making their progression feel more impactful.
