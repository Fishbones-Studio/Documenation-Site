# Fire Ball

A slow, expanding projectile that grows fiercer as it travels.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Vision:** Visualize a majestic, expanding fireball.
2. **Shapes:** Custom Blender meshes: a UV sphere head, core, and trailing meshes.
3. **Enhancement:** GPUParticle3D emits spark particles from the rear.
4. **Composition:** Combines custom meshes, particles, and shaders.
