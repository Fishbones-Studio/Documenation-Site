The Coop is the dedicated training area in Fowl Play, designed to help players learn combat, movement, and hazard mechanics in a safe. Here, you can experiment with your abilities and weapons, learn new techniques, and interact with sentient training dummies, each with their own unique personality.

The Coop is divided into three main sections, each focused on a different aspect of gameplay:

## Combat Section

Located in the middle of the arena, this area features a training dummy eager to be your sparring partner. Here, you can:

- Practice melee, ranged, and ability attacks.
- Test combos and timing.
- Receive feedback and tips from the masochistic Combat Specialist Dummy, who delights in being attacked and offers theatrical, vivid explanations of combat mechanics.

## Hazards Section

This section provides an overview and safe demonstration of all arena hazards, including:

- [Regular spike](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/hazards/spikes)
- [Ground saw](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/hazards/ground-saw)
- [Spike ball](/fowl-play/gameplay/combat/hazards/spike-ball)

You can:

- Learn how each hazard works and how to avoid or use them strategically.
- Practice environmental awareness and hazard manipulation.
- Get tactical advice from the Hazard Instructor Dummy, who treats training like a military drill and emphasizes survival and cleverness.

### Healing Station

The hazards section also features a healing station, where you can recover health after practicing in the training area. These healing stations are also present in the intermission area's, however those require a payment.

## Movement Section

A platform high in the sky lets you practice advanced movement:

- Jump, double jump, and glide as a chicken.
- Experiment with dashing, sprinting, and combining moves.
- Receive gentle encouragement and safety tips from the Movement Tutor Dummy, who acts as a nurturing mentor.

## Training Dummies

Each section features its own sentient training dummy:

- **Combat Specialist**: Loves being attacked, offers enthusiastic and poetic combat advice.
- **Hazard Instructor**: Pragmatic and tactical, explains hazards and survival strategies.
- **Movement Tutor**: Motherly and supportive, teaches movement with warmth and care.

You can attack, talk to, and learn from these dummies. Each dummy is a different character, providing both gameplay tips and world lore. For more on their personalities, see [Character Sheets](/fowl-play/story/character-sheets).

## Area Layout

The Coop uses the same arena as the intermission area, but with unique props and setups for training. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the environment you'll encounter in real matches, but in a risk-free setting.

In general, the Coop is designed to be large and open. This gives the player plenty of space to move around and practice their skills without feeling cramped. There is verticality present to allow for more advanced movement techniques.
