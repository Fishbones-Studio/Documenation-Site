The Random SFX Player is a simple, focused implementation of the [BaseRandomAudioPlayer](/fowl-play/gameplay/audio/random-players/base-random-audio-player) designed specifically for sound effects. It provides immediate playback of random audio files from a specified folder, making it ideal for impact sounds, UI feedback, weapon sounds, and other event-driven audio.

## Design Philosophy

The RandomSFXPlayer embodies the principle of simplicity and single responsibility:

1. **Single Purpose**: Does one thing well, it plays random sound effects.

2. **Immediate Response**: No delays, fading, or complex transitions. When `play_random()` is called, audio plays immediately.

3. **Minimal Configuration**: Inherits all configuration from [BaseRandomAudioPlayer](/fowl-play/gameplay/audio/random-players/base-random-audio-player) without adding complexity.

4. **Fire-and-Forget**: Perfect for one-shot sound effects that don't require ongoing management.

## The Code

```gdscript
## Plays a random audio from a folder when play_random() is called.
class_name RandomSFXPlayer
extends BaseRandomAudioPlayer

func play_random() -> void:
	if _available_streams.is_empty():
		push_warning(
			"RandomSFXPlayer: No audio files available to play from '%s'."
			% audio_folder
		)
		return

	var next_sfx_stream := _get_next_random_stream()
	if next_sfx_stream:
		stream = next_sfx_stream
		play()
	else:
		# This might happen if _get_next_random_stream somehow fails, though unlikely
		# if _available_streams was not empty.
		push_warning(
			"RandomSFXPlayer: Could not get a valid audio stream to play."
		)
```

### Error Handling

This class checks for two main conditions before attempting to play audio:

```gdscript
if _available_streams.is_empty():
    # First check: Are there any audio files loaded?

var next_sfx_stream := _get_next_random_stream()
if next_sfx_stream:
    # Second check: Did the selection process succeed?
```

This approach provides:

1. **Clear Error Messages**: Different error conditions produce different warning messages, making debugging easier.

2. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed audio doesn't crash the game or break the calling code.

3. **Defensive Programming**: Handles edge cases that theoretically shouldn't happen but might in practice.

### When to Use

#### Suitable for

- Weapon impact sounds
- UI button clicks and interactions
- Footstep variations
- Environmental interaction sounds (door opening, item pickup, etc.)
- Quick, one-shot audio feedback

#### Not Suitable for

- Background music (use [RandomMusicPlayer](/fowl-play/gameplay/audio/random-players/random-music-player))
- Ambient soundscapes (use [IntervalAudioPlayer](/fowl-play/gameplay/audio/interval-players/interval-audio-player))
- Audio that needs crossfading or complex transitions
- Continuous or looping sounds

### Configuration Inheritance

The class inherits all configuration from BaseRandomAudioPlayer:

- `audio_folder`: Directory containing the SFX files
- `file_extensions`: Supported audio formats
- `avoid_repeats`: Prevents immediate sound repetition

This inheritance means you get all the robust file loading and randomization logic without any additional complexity.

## Tips

1. **Keep files short** - SFX should typically be under 2-3 seconds for responsive gameplay.

2. **Match volumes carefully** - Ensure all variations have similar volume levels to maintain consistency.

3. **Test repeat avoidance** - With `avoid_repeats` enabled, make sure you have at least 2-3 variations to prevent obvious patterns.

4. **Consider attenuation** - Since this extends AudioStreamPlayer3D, configure the attenuation curve for realistic distance falloff.

5. **Use descriptive names** - Clear audio file names help with debugging and content management.
