There are a variety of abilities your chicken can equip. The chicken is allowed to have two different abilities equipped at the same time. These abilities will make the game feel more exciting and different. Abilities scale off of different types of stats such as stamina, attack, weight or max health.

## Glacial Prism / Avalanche

Glacial Prism is an area-of-effect ability. When cast, it summons a burst of ice pillars around the nearest enemy, inflicting damage and significantly slowing them for 5 seconds. This ability's effectiveness scales with the user's current speed and attack stats. The Glacial Prism is not exclusive to player chickens and is also utilized by the ice fox

Glacial Prism is a rework of the old Avalanche ability. These abilities are almost the same. However, the ability now spawns in a burst of ice pillars around the nearest enemy, slowing and reducing their defense for 8 seconds.

## Crescent slash

Crescent Slash deals massive amounts of damage by dealing true damage, ignoring the target's defense. Its power increases with the user's attack stat. This ability is also used by Timmy, one of the enemies.

## Ground Pound

Ground Pound is an aerial ability that causes the user to rapidly descend to the ground. Upon landing, it generates a burst of damage in an area surrounding the impact point. The effectiveness of this ability scales with the user's weight. In order to activate this ability, the user must be in the air.

## Earthquake

Earthquake is a variation of the Ground Pound ability. It can be activated while in the air, propelling the user to the ground. Upon impact, it unleashes three powerful bursts of energy, knocking back any targets caught within the area. This ability's damage scales with the user's weight. It is a signature ability of Bob.

## Fire Ball

Fireball is a projectile ability that moves forward slowly, for several seconds. The damage dealt by Fire Ball depends on the user's current stamina, and its activation consumes half of the user's current stamina. This ability cannot be used if the player's stamina is below the required threshold. The Woodpecker uses this ability.

## Seas of Flame

Seas of Flame creates an area of continuous burn damage around the user. The damage dealt by this ability scales with both the user's current percentage of health and their attack stat. Activating Seas of Flames costs 25% of the user’s max health, and it cannot drop the user’s health below 1%.

## Sanctuary of Firebloom

Sanctuary of Firebloom is an ability that strikes the nearest enemy with five powerful lightning bolts. The damage dealt by these lightning strikes scales directly with the user's attack stats. This ability is used by the Elder Centipede.
