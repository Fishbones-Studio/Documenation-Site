## Gameplay considerations

- **Strengths**: Good range and moderate damage, decent attack speed. Makes for a good neutral weapon, for all playstyles.
- **Weaknesses**: Slower attack and cooldown compared to faster weapons.
- **Best Used**: For players who want a balance between speed and power.

## Animations

- **Attack**: The leek scales up and rotates backward, then swings forward to attack, quickly returning to its original state.
- **Cooldown**: The leek twirls upward, spinning and scaling up and down for a dynamic effect.
- **Idle**: The leek shrinks, rotates slightly, and bounces back, giving it a lively idle motion.
