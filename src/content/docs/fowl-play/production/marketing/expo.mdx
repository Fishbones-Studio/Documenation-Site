## Trailers

### Trailer One

To market our game, we’ve created two trailers, showing various parts of the game. These trailers will be released at different dates, in order to keep interest high. We’re planning on making and releasing a final release trailer, once the game is done.

**Trailer One:**
This trailer shows off the gameplay aspects of Fowl Play, going in a slight montage direction. It uses a free to use song.

### Trailer Two

**Trailer Two:**
This is more of an announcement trailer. It focuses a bit more on the narrative and roguelike aspects of the game. The trailer uses original music composed for the game.

## Posters, Flyers, Badges

### Ads

These ads were hung up during the first and second playtest, and two are featured on the T-Shirt designs. We want to hang these up during the expo as well, since they show our art style and invoke a sense of intrigue.

## Product Page
