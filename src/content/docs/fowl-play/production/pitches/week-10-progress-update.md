## Poultry Man Menu

The Poultry Man menu serves as an in-game interface where players can interact with various functionalities. Initially, the menu design did not match the intended atmosphere of the game. The latest update enhances the visual and interactive aspects of the menu to better fit the eerie, gritty theme of a scientist mutating and sacrificing chickens.

### New Version

To improve the menu and align it with the game’s dark and griddy theme, several enhancements were made: - **Darkened the World**: Instead of an open-sky background, the environment is now much darker, reinforcing the eerie and unsettling atmosphere. - **Added a Wall**: A wall was introduced to enclose the menu area, making it feel more like a confined, eerie laboratory where unethical experiments take place. - **Dynamic Lighting**: A flashing light effect was added to create a more unsettling atmosphere, making the environment feel more alive and foreboding. - **Added Labels**: Labels were introduced to indicate what each item does, providing players with clear information about where each item leads. - **Hover Effects**: When players hover over an item, the label changes color and the node increases in size, making it more visually distinct and responsive. - **Keyboard & Controller Navigation**: Players can now navigate the menu using both a keyboard and a controller.
