## Player HUD v3

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: playerHudV3Image,
      alt: "Player HUD v3",
      title: "Player HUD v3",
      width: 600,
      height: 400,
    },
  ]}
  columns={1}
  imageWidth={600}
  imageHeight={400}
/>
We've removed the rounds timer and moved the player HUD to the bottom-left
corner and added a large red health bar with the enemy's name at the top-center
of the screen to create a classic boss fight feel. Every enemy now uses this
health bar since arena fights are always a 1v1. This change also makes it easier
to track the enemy's health without having to look at a small bar above their
head.

### Control Icons

You may have already noticed that the items in the bottom-right corner now have control icons. We added these so players can easily see which buttons perform actions for each item, without needing to check the settings. The icon pack comes from [rsubtil’s controller pack](github.com/rsubtil/controller_icons/), which is widely used in games like The Outer Worlds. We chose this pack not only for its familiar and consistent style, but also because it's easy to implement in Godot.

## Updated Shops

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: equipmentShopImage,
      alt: "Updated Equipment Shop",
      title: "Updated Equipment Shop",
      width: 400,
      height: 300,
    },
    {
      src: upgradeShopImage,
      alt: "Updated Upgrade Shop",
      title: "Updated Upgrade Shop",
      width: 400,
      height: 300,
    },
  ]}
  columns={2}
  imageWidth={400}
  imageHeight={300}
/>
We updated the main shop and the upgrade shop design by placing the item list on
the left side and displaying the selected (hovered) item on the right, along
with a clear description of what it does. Additionally, we've moved the currency
display to the top right corner, each with its respective icon for better
clarity.

### Added Rebirth Shop

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: rebirthShopImage,
      alt: "Rebirth Shop",
      title: "Rebirth Shop",
      width: 600,
      height: 400,
    },
  ]}
  columns={1}
  imageWidth={600}
  imageHeight={400}
/>
We also finally added the Rebirth Shop! Players can now purchase permanent
upgrades for their stats, including damage, max health, speed, defense, and
stamina. Each upgrade becomes more expensive as the level increases, so you’ll
need to spend your Rebirth Feathers wisely.

## Loading Screen

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: loadingScreenImage,
      alt: "Loading Screen",
      title: "Loading Screen",
      width: 600,
      height: 400,
    },
  ]}
  columns={1}
  imageWidth={600}
  imageHeight={400}
/>
We observed a noticeable freeze when entering the arena. This occurred because
the game was loading a large scene all at once, without any indication to the
player that something was happening. The result was a jarring pause that gave
the impression the game was unresponsive.

To resolve this and improve the user experience, we introduced a loading screen. This screen masks the loading time and adds personality by displaying concept art, a progress-bar, and random chicken facts to keep the player engaged.

## Improved Poultry Man Menu

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: poultryManMenuImage,
      alt: "Improved Poultry man Menu",
      title: "Improved Poultry man Menu",
      width: 600,
      height: 400,
    },
  ]}
  columns={1}
  imageWidth={600}
  imageHeight={400}
/>
We’ve also refreshed the look of our Poultry Man menu by replacing the block
nodes with actual items, giving it a more appealing and polished appearance.

## Confirmation Screens

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: confirmationScreenImage,
      alt: "Confirmation Screen",
      title: "Confirmation Screen",
      width: 600,
      height: 400,
    },
  ]}
  columns={1}
  imageWidth={600}
  imageHeight={400}
/>
We have added a general confirmation screen to all important sections of the
game where mis click can occur. This is used to prevent the player from
accidentally buying equipment or sacrificing their chicken. Additionally, the
confirmation screen also serves as a popup of information, as it helps inform
the player of what the certain action will have for impact.
