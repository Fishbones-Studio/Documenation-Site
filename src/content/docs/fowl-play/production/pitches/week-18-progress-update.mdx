We’ve finalized the Poultry Man menu, and it’s now much more polished and
immersive. The menu takes place in a fully built model room, complete with
detailed visuals and atmosphere. There’s now an actual table where items can be
placed and displayed, making it feel more interactive and grounded. This helps
give the menu a stronger sense of space and makes navigating it more enjoyable.

## Difficulty Options and Arena Selection Changes

During playtesting, we saw that many players had a hard time surviving the fixed boss battle arenas. In fowl play, each arena drop includes three rounds, with the last round always being a boss fight. A lot of players reached the boss with limited gear after already fighting two tough enemies, and they didn’t stand much of a chance. This made the experience feel frustrating and overly punishing.
To give players more choice and control over their experience, we added three arena options:

- Arena with Boss Battle: This is the original, full challenge mode. Players face two regular enemy waves and a boss in the third round. It’s the only mode where you can earn Feathers of Rebirth, which are used to buy permanent upgrades. It's tough, but meant to reward players who can survive the full challenge.

- Arena without Boss Battle: This version ends after two enemy waves, with no boss fight. It’s a safer way to farm Prosperity Eggs and buy better gear before taking on harder content. You don’t get Feathers of Rebirth here, because we want players to earn those through real challenges.

- Training Arena: A risk-free environment where players can test out weapons and abilities without worrying about dying. It’s perfect for experimenting and getting used to different gear and playstyles.

These changes aim to give players a smoother and more flexible experience, while still keeping the game’s core challenge and rewards meaningful.

A new stat overview has been added, displaying your current values. When you
hover over an upgrade item, it now shows what stat you're upgrading, how much it
will increase, and the bonus it provides. Additionally, the reset stats also
tell how much currency you will get refunded.

## New Training Ground: The Coop

We've added a new training area called the Coop! Here, players can learn the basics of the game by testing out their weapons and abilities in a safe, controlled environment. It's the perfect place to sharpen your skills before jumping into the action.

## New Arena: Skydome

Introducing the Skydome, a brand new arena designed like a high-stakes cage fight under the open sky. Surrounded by a roaring crowd of spectators, this intense battleground brings the action to a whole new level.

## Mutations and Variants

The idea of mutations for the chicken player has been completely dropped, in favour of the abilities. This decision was made due to time constraints and different priorities. For 3D, we decided to focus more on the enemy designs and animations, since that is what seemed to grab player attention the most during the playtests. If we were to continue development of this game, the player character should get better animations, model changes and variants to better fit the story we designed for Fowl Play.
