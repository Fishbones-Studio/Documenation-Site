**Inventory System**

<br />
In your inventory, you can view the items you've purchased from the store. Please
note that you can only hold one item per category at a time. Keep in mind that the
items in your inventory do not yet reflect your current loadout in the arena yet.

## Player HUD

### Current HUD

The current in-game HUD is designed to keep essential combat information accessible without cluttering the screen: - **Top Left**: the stamina and health bar. This area is reserved for quick-glance survival stats.
