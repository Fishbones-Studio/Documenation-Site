- **International scope** - Poultry Men travel globally to find the best fighters

### The Arenas

These arenas are:

  - Often situated in _repurposed industrial zones_ or _forgotten sewer systems_
- **Harsh and unforgiving environments** - Designed to test survival instincts

## Storytelling Approach

The primary focus of our game is **not the story**. Instead, the narrative serves as a carefully crafted backdrop to enhance the atmosphere and immerse players in the gritty world of underground chicken fighting.

### Story's Role in Gameplay

The story will mainly serve to:

- **Explain and enhance the setting** - Providing context for why this brutal world exists
- **Provide context for the arena environment** - Making the fighting locations feel lived-in and authentic
- **Add atmospheric depth through dialogue** - Characters reveal glimpses of the larger world through conversations
- **Create emotional investment** - Connecting players to the characters and their struggles

### Narrative Scope & Limitations

We will explicitly only ever show:

- The **arena** where fights take place
  - Various underground locations with unique hazards
- The **room** where the Poultry Man manages the chicken
  - The player's preparation and recovery space

> **Design Philosophy**: The outside world will remain a mystery, with only occasional small glimpses revealed through character dialogue and environmental storytelling. This creates intrigue while keeping the focus on the immediate, visceral experience of the arena.
