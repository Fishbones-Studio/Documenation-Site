## Philosophy

The Poultry Man Menu Theme is composed of several loosely connected musical fragments, all designed to evoke a sense of abandonment and isolation. At its core lies a continuous wind sound, establishing the desolate atmosphere of the underground sewer where the Poultry Man area is set.

Additional ambient tracks are layered on top, at random intervals. These pieces are slow and ethereal, built around gentle chord progressions, which enhance the mood without feeling overly somber. Each segment lasts between 40 and 80 seconds. Once a track finishes, only the wind remains, reinforcing the feeling of emptiness until the next ambient track appears.

### Connection to Game Themes

The musicâ€™s sparse and minimal design fits with its area:

1. **Abandonment**: The persistent wind and minimal instrumentation convey emptiness and neglect.
2. **Mystery**: The unpredictability of random intervals mirrors the Poultry Man's elusive presence. Little is known about the Poultry Man.
3. **Isolation**: Long stretches with little to no melody emphasize the solitary atmosphere of the setting.

## Musical Parts

The Poultry Man Menu Theme is structured around a simple yet effective layering system:

1. **Base Layer**: A continuous wind sound forms the backdrop. Subtle variation in notes ensure the wind sound varies and doesn't become too tiring.
2. **Ambient Tracks**: Currently, three distinct tracks are randomly triggered over the base layer. While they share similar instrumentation, each features unique chord progressions and arrangements to add variety and depth. The ambient tracks are designed to complement the base layer, enhancing the overall atmosphere and emotional impact of the theme.
