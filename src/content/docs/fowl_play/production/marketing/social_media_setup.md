## Social Media Accounts

In order to promote and give insights into our game, social media profiles were created. These accounts have the following purposes:

- **Gather valuable feedback:** By putting our game out there publicly will hopefully lead to valuable input from others.
- **Building community:** Engaging with an audience helps create a sense of connection and interest around our project.
- **Develop professional skills:** Managing social media accounts and interacting with followers gives us hands-on experience in digital marketing and communication. Interaction with fellow game developers can give valuable insights and improvements to our workflow.
- **Enhance visibility:** Regular updates and interactions help keep our content relevant, making it more likely to catch the attention of potential players or even future employers.

While building a fully engaged community is near impossible due to the limited time frame and the fact that this is a school project, these efforts still provide us with valuable experience and exposure. It will at least look good on our resumes ðŸ˜‰.
