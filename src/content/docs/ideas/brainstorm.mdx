## Hague Horror school

<p style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  3D low poly, psychological horror, story driven, choices matter, PC
</p>

### Game inspirations

- How fish are made (adventure horror, philosophic)
  - Mouthwashing (psychological horror)
- Little nightmares (adventure horror)
- Webfishing (art style)
- Baldies basics (gameplay, school setting)
- FNaF security breach Ruin (two overlapping worlds)
  - Fnaf into the pit

### Game elements

- Keep the user ‘On edge’ by having the user seek light to keep them alive.
- Player needs to solve puzzles around the map.
- Keep jump scares to a minimum.

### Story

Years ago, a terrific accident happened at the school, which according to urban legends caused the souls of former students to be trapped there. You play as a teenager who likes exploring abandoned old buildings. You become trapped inside. It is your mission to uncover what happened and help the trapped souls move on.

### Gameplay

Players spawns into an abandoned school where they need to collect items to survive and find their way out of the school.

- **Reality Switch: **Shift between the "real" decaying school and the pixilated, grotesque “dream” version.
  - These versions have differences. Some areas are only accessible via real, some only via dream.
  - Students in “real” are friendly, in “dream” enemies.
- **Fear meter**: Fear meter will go up by being in the dark too long,
  - Will also go up during scripted gameplay moments.
  - Will go down by finding lights.
  - Ties in with the reality switch, min fear “real”, max fear “dream”.
  - Staying in max fear too long causes death.
- **Puzzles**:
  - **Calming Rituals**: Solve environmental puzzles to "bury" memories (e.g., arrange broken toys at a shrine). This makes the spirits able to move on and permanently stabilizes that area.
    - **Sacrifice**: Ability to permanently sacrifice students
      - Causes that area to be permanently destabilized.
    - These decisions will block off certain paths.

### Aesthetics

Webfishing- and moutwashing-inspired low-poly with PS1-era textures. Environments degrade as fear increases—walls bleed pixelated "static," floors crack into void-like geometry. Max fear looks more like mouthwashing/how fish are made, min fear looks more like webfishing.

### Target Audience

- Teenagers/Adults
- Horror fans
- Retro gaming enthusiasts drawn to PS1-era aesthetics

### Why Interesting

- Combines nostalgic aesthetics with modern psychological horror.
- Forces players to grapple with _meaningful_ choices, not just jump scares.

### Why do we want to do this

Interested in horror. The ability to focus on storytelling, trying to create a compelling and thought provoking story.

## battle arena swarm

<p style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  3D low poly, Round-based, simple art style, niche playable characters, PC
</p>

### Game inspirations

- Warframe (for the upgrade/deck system)
- Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 (swarm)

### Story

Across the multiverse, there is a deadly threat known as The Swarm, an unstoppable force that consumes entire universes, leaving nothing but void. According to legend, only the strongest champions from different universes can stand against it.

You play as a warrior, chosen from your world and pulled into the pit, the pit is where fighters from across universes are teleported to. You become trapped in this endless cycle of combat. It is your mission to grow stronger, survive the pit, and push back The Swarm before it devours everything.

### Aesthetics

The Pit is dark, dirty and grim. The ground is cracked, covered in blood, and there’s old, rusty metal everywhere. Smoke fills the air, Chains hang from the walls, and bones are scattered around with weapons scattered around the grounds.

### Swarm

The Swarm are insect-like aliens with sharp, spiky bodies, armored exoskeletons are covered in jagged edges

(something like this)

### Gameplay

In this game, you will enter the pit with your own deck of cards that have buffs to make your character stronger. The pit is round based, with every round more and more powerful enemies appearing. After every 5 rounds, you can choose the following

- **Continue** and get the chance to earn better cards
- **Leave** to secure your loot.

Beware, if you decide to continue and die in a round, you will lose everything that you have earned and even your current deck of cards.

### Cards & Upgrades

Your character will become stronger with cards. Cards will determine your playstyle.

This game will have 2 types of Cards:

1. **Ace-cards**

- Gives simple buffs like, more attack speed, extra HP, more damage.
- Comes as loot from common enemies and can be upgraded with souls points that are dropped from common enemies as well

2. **Joker-cards**

- Super powerful cards with a drawback.
- Are dropped by Elite Enemies and can be upgraded with Joker Points which are also dropped by Elite Enemies
- Examples:
- +300% DMG, but you can receive 50% more DMG yourself.
- You are 50% faster but lose stamina 10% faster.

Your Character will only begin with 1 card slot and will earn 1 slot for every level he levels up, you can have a maximum of 10 cards.

### Extraction & Progression

When Entering the pit with your character you will start at round 1, this will only have a couple of enemies and when you defeat them, you will go to the next round, after every 5 rounds you will get the option to leave the pit, you can opt to stay in the pit but beware that you will have to survive another 5 rounds before you get a chance to leave the pit,

Final enemy in the fifth round, something along the lines of a boss. Every round, the enemies will become more difficult, but they will drop better loot.

After extracting along with the cards you found, you get some kind of currency to allow for more starting slots for example.

### Why Interesting

this game is interesting because it combines the thrill of fighting stronger enemies each round with the tension of deciding whether to risk everything for better rewards or leave safely with your loot.

The card system also lets players customize their own character’s strength and making their character unique to theirs, making runs feel different.

### Why do we want to do this

We had a couple of different mechanics and ideas that we put into one ‘Swarm’ game. This type of game matched the different ideas the best.

### Target Audience

Todo

## Chicken Fight Ring / Chicken Fight Colosseum (CFC)

<p style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  3D low poly, Round-based, low poly art style, customizable playable
  characters, PC
</p>

Grow your chicken from egg, make sure they’re strong and start modding them/drugging them to make them strong and evolve your chicken to the ultimate chicken-champion.

### Game elements

- Shop with vials of drugs (different shapes of bottles and substances, but you don't necessarily know what they consist of, so it's going to be a ‘random’ chicken upgrade)
- Shop with robot-esque modification: chicken-arm-saw, Ultimate chicken shredder jaw, Minigun egg shooter, etc.
- Incubator if dissatisfied with current egg, press a button and you get a new egg with

  random stats. This costs currency that is won in the arena.

- Permadeath, if your chicken dies in the arena, you get a new egg.
- Select a class at the start of the game that determines what kind of items you will be able to receive during the run of the game. (**maybe too much)**
  - The class can also determine the story the game will follow. (**maybe to broad)**

### Interface

- Maybe the interface/menu can be a big desk you’re looking down on with the flyers from the arena, a big incubator/ cage with your chicken and other props. -> you can switch to a different desk that can be the shop/workstation for example where you can modify your chicken -> switch to another desk with other upgrades like vials to mutate your chicken etc.
- You play as your chicken trainer in the menu where you can upgrade, grow and modify your chicken. This is all done through interfaces.
- To get into the fighting game play part of the game there will be flyers of arenas you can contest in, the harder the arena the more currency you can earn.

### Gameplay

- Play as the chicken, clunky controls (think of gang beasts)
- when entering the arena to collect coins for upgrading your chicken
- If your chicken dies, you have to restart over and grow your new one
- when entering fight ring, POV shifts to chicken and u play as the chicken
- To prevent losing your expensive-modified chicken, you can also buy something that can revive your chicken. This is in limited supply, not always possible.
- decisions between what kinds of fights you take, depending on the choice, the reward type will differ.
- If you want to start over with your chicken, you can put it in a meat grinder and start over

### Arena

- RNG, dangers, fight against other chickens and other enemies: (natural enemies of chickens, like dogs, raccoons, foxes, snakes, skunk, mutated rats (could be bosses)
- differentiate between small bosses, big bosses & special bosses

  for example; small bosses are other chickens, big bosses are natural predators of chickens(see examples above) and special bosses are huge mutated chickens (centipede chicken as example)

### Combat

- Chickens will have different possible abilities depending on modification and items
- Melee item slot and Ranged item slot
- Armor
- Abilities are gained from certain items, cyborg modifications and Drug modifications
- The player will be limited to x modifications and abilities
- exploding eggs, environmental hazards

### Aesthetics

- underground fight ring vibe
- mechanical saws, flamethrowers, etc
- How fish are made
- low poly, own made up style, &lt;- WIP

### Easter Eggs

- Name your chicken ‘Kip Jong-un’ to get a red button that launches a nuclear attack
- Name your chicken ‘Donald Duck’ to get a cool hat
- Petauw en Saartje

### Enemies

(natural predators of chickens)

- Raccoons
- Opossums
- skunks
- foxes
- snakes
- weasels
- coyote
- dogs
- rats
- Other enhanced or normal chickens

### Why Interesting

It’s interesting, because it has multiple elements; like the interface where you can really get into customizing, but also the gameplay, which is supposed to not only be intense, but also fun and goofy. The game has a humoristic/dark touch to it which will intrigue possible players. Due to the fact your chicken can die easily, and you have to start over, it will have a lot of replayability.

### Why do we want to do this

stumbled on the idea and expanded it over time which gained more interest from everyone.

### Target Audience

- 16+

## Scrapped Ideas

### Tower Defense Deck Builder

<p style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  Tower defense, deck builder, 2D
</p>

Combining a deck builder system with Tower Defense. Adds an element of randomness to each run.

#### Games inspo

- Plants vs zombies
- Balatro
- BloonsTD

### Storyweaver

<p style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>Story, Puzzle, 3D</p>

**Core Concept**: \
Create stories with DDLC-style meta-twists across genres (school life, sci-fi, romance). Settings dynamically alter puzzle types and narrative rules.

**Gameplay**:

- **Branching Architect**: Write dialogue/plot points with _consequence tracking_ – minor choices resurface as major twists later.
- **3D Puzzle Fusion**: Solve environment-based puzzles to unlock story paths (e.g., hack computers in a cyberpunk plot, arrange memories in a dementia-themed drama).
- **Twist Engine**: AI randomizes "corruption" events (glitched text, save file manipulation) proportional to story complexity.

**Tools**:

- Built with [Dialogic](https://docs.dialogic.pro) for nonlinear dialogue systems.
- **Twist Editor**: Toggle fourth-wall breaks and horror elements (e.g., character awareness of player inputs).

**Risk System**:

- Overloading the narrative with too many twists risks "corrupting" save files until puzzles solve the instability.

**Style**:

- 3D diorama-style scenes with 2D character sprites.
- Multiple "canon" endings + secret endings for breaking narrative logic.

### Go game

<p style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>2D, Board Game, Visual Novel</p>

#### Core Gameplay

1v1 [Go matches ](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)>)with characters providing match buffs (e.g., extra stone placement, territory bonuses). So, playing against machine/AI.

#### Progression

- **Character Collection**: Gacha-style unlocks with unique abilities tied to Go strategies.
- **Tournament Story**: Rise through ranks, facing themed opponents (samurai, hackers, etc.).
- **Relationship System**: Dialogue choices between matches affect character loyalty and buff potency.

#### Risk System

- Bet collected characters as "stakes" in high-level matches. Lose = permalock their buffs until re-earned.

#### Style

- Visual novel segments with branching storylines.
- Multiple endings based on tournament performance/character relationships.

### Baby Colosseum

<p style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>3D, multiplayer</p>

Battle Royale with playable babies.

### Bound by Cards

<p style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  Extraction souls like, 3D, bosh rush?, rougelite
</p>

#### Gameplay Concept

Arena-based rounds with escalating enemy waves. After each round, choose:

- **Continue** for better cards.
- **Extract** to secure loot. \
  _Permadeath_: Die and lose all collected items/cards.

##### Combat System

For Honor-style directional combat (left/right/overhead) with lock-on (L2/LB/Shift).

- **Light Attack** (R1): Fast, low damage.
- **Heavy Attack**: Slow, high damage.

##### Cards & Upgrades

- **Ace Cards**: Basic buffs (attack speed, HP, damage). Upgraded with _Souls_ (dropped by enemies).
- **Joker Cards**: Powerful effects with trade-offs (e.g., +300% damage but +50% incoming damage). Upgraded with _Joker Points_ (boss drops).
- Start with 1 card slot; unlock up to 10 via level-ups.

##### Extraction & Progression

- Risk-reward: Deeper progression = better rewards but higher loss risk.
- _Souls_ and _Joker Points_ reset on death. Strategically extract after rounds to preserve progress.
